		<h2>Full Stack Web Developer</h2>
		<h3 class="orange-highlight">2024(february)| Pro Level Developer</h3>
		<p>I wanted to be a Full Stack Web Developer. For this i need to learn HTML, CSS and Javascript. But i don't want to stop here, I also wanted to learn server and security development and SEO. And i believe “A website without SEO is like a car with no gas.” If you think math is hard, try web design.</p>
